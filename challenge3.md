Challenge Description:
In this coding challenge, you'll create a Python program to simulate a quantum portal system. Quantum portals can exist in multiple states simultaneously and allow for probabilistic teleportation. Your task is to design a Python class that manages quantum portals and their teleportation.

You need to implement a Python class named `QuantumPortalManager` with methods to:

Initialize the quantum portal system with a list of quantum portals.
Create new quantum portals and add them to the system.
Teleport objects through the quantum portals, considering probabilistic teleportation.
The challenge involves:

Managing quantum portal states and handling teleportation probabilities.
Keeping track of the current location and the destinations of quantum portals.
Simulating quantum teleportation where an object may arrive at multiple destinations simultaneously with certain probabilities.
