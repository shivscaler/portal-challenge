Title: "Wormhole Travel Challenge"

Challenge Description:
In this coding challenge, you'll implement a program that simulates interstellar wormholes, allowing for instantaneous travel between distant parts of the universe. Your task is to design a Python class to manage wormholes and navigate through them.

You need to implement a Python class named WormholeNavigator with methods to:

Initialize the wormhole network with a list of connected wormholes.
Create new wormholes and add them to the network.
Navigate through the wormholes to travel from one location to another.
The challenge involves:

Managing wormhole connections and ensuring valid travel routes.
Keeping track of the current location and the destinations of wormholes.
Handling scenarios where navigating through wormholes may lead to unexpected results.
